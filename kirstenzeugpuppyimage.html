There's no debating it: Puppies are adorable. But is there an age when they reach "peak" cuteness?<p>

<p style="background-color:Violet;">
A new study may have an answer. The study, which aimed to determine the "optimal age" of puppy cuteness, found that puppies are most appealing to humans at around 6 to 8 weeks of age. That's around the time when puppies are weaned from their mothers, leading the researchers to hypothesize that puppies reach peak cuteness right when they need human care the most.</p>
